*After clone a project down from github, run npm install to install all necessary dependencies
and $ npm run build to create a dist folder with a bundle.js file


First install webpack as a development dependency: $ npm install webpack@4.0.1 —save-dev

For use to access webpack from the command line we install a package: $ npm install webpack-cli@2.0.9 —save-dev

All dependencies will be included in the devDependencies in the package.json file

Two methods of installing dependencies are first typing the name of the dependency in the package.json file then running $ npm install, or installing directly in the terminal by specifying the dependency

To remove dependencies you simply remove its reference from the package.json file and then run  $ npm prune

To install the npm package for jQuery run $npm install jquery —save

When committing each file with git

1. $ git status
2. $ git diff to verify
3. $ git add (specific filename)
4. $ git commit

In package.json, in the scripts property add “build: “webpack”

Then we create a webpack.config.js file where we’ll configure

Then we at the root level we create a dist folder where index.html will be store as well as a src folder where main.js and journal.js and all other js source code files

run $ npm build to invoke webpack to create a bundle.js file
